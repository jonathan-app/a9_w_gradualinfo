description: 'Run /develop to build a feature, UI or backend, from an approved design, a page, component, API, service, or data slice. If something load bearing is undecided and no spec records it, it stops and routes you to /architect; otherwise it reads the spec plus AGENTS.md, builds, and advances the scope.'

## Output style (plain words, no dashes, no hyphens)

<!-- OUTPUT-STYLE:START -->

Write everything this skill produces, files and messages alike, in plain simple language. Talk to the reader as `you`, warm and direct like a colleague, and present choices as recommendations, while stating required project gates clearly. Keep technical terms that carry real meaning; explain each in plain words. Never use a dash or a hyphen as punctuation: no em dash, no en dash, and no hyphenated compounds. Write `read only`, not `read-only`. Say it in simple words, or reword the sentence. Code, file paths, command flags, and values other skills match on keep their hyphens. Use short sentences, commas, or parentheses. Clear beats clever.

## Local workflow contract

Before routing, read `AGENTS.md`, `workflow/STATE.md`, and `docs/workflow/governance.md` from the repository root. The local contract governs decisions, required gates, evidence, and delivery status in every mode below.

## What this skill does

The builder: turns a spec plus project conventions into working code. Tracks: **UI** (components, pages, layouts; `ui-guide.md`), **Logical** (APIs, services, data layers, business logic, integrations; `logical-guide.md`), or both (e.g. "auth" = sign in pages plus session logic → run both). Step 0 gates on the spec so load bearing choices (an auth approach, a payment provider) are decided in `/architect`, not silently invented partway through the build.

## Asks vs acts

Gates, then acts: no upfront question rounds like `/architect`. Read the decision, build, ask only what the design left open (the visual direction when no reference was given; a business rule the spec didn't settle). Infer from the spec, `AGENTS.md`, and codebase; recommend local implementation choices.

## Artifact ownership

- Writes app code (plus CSS and tokens for UI).
- Scope (`docs/scope/PLAN.md`): only the Step 4 touches (feature status → `in-progress`, milestone sub boxes, `Build it` box, code pointer). Updates delivery progress in `workflow/STATE.md`.
- Never writes spec content or deliberates a decision (flags the need, defers to `/architect`); never restructures root `AGENTS.md` (that's `/audit`); new area conventions go via `/sync` afterwards. Never creates specs or uses Assumed status (per `AGENTS.md`, Assumed status is prohibited to unblock development).
- Prerequisite: The governing spec must have `Status: Accepted` with explicit decision sources. `/develop` never advances or alters the spec decision status. Delivery progress belongs strictly in `workflow/STATE.md` and `docs/scope/PLAN.md`.
- Artifact base: `docs/` by default, `.workflow/` if `docs/` is a published docs site. Read from whichever exists (paths here assume `docs/`).
- Shared scope: read it again right before ticking, edit only the specific checkbox, status, or pointer line (never rewrite the file); feature not as expected (already `done`, reworked) → flag, do not overwrite.

## Portability (any OS, any agent)

Any Agent Skills client, macOS/Linux/Windows. Detection snippets are POSIX reference; use your agent's own cross platform file tools. Builds inline on the main thread (Step 3); the only subagents are a read only `scout` that explores code (Step 2.5) and a read only `researcher` for a doc check (Step 2.6, degrading to building from knowledge without web capability), both on the cheapest model. Bundled guides (`ui-guide.md`, `logical-guide.md`, `checklist.md`) and the build flow after the gate (`flow/build.md`) are paths relative to this skill's folder; the main thread reads them. No interactive question picker → ask the prompts as plain text with the same options.

## Execution

### Before you build: the project must already exist (except the scaffold task)

Exception: if this IS the scaffold sub task of the Stack and architecture foundation feature (prompt says `scaffold`, or the step initializes the project from the stack spec), creating the project IS the job. Read the ARCHITECTURE spec's `## Proposed stack`; run the framework's own project initializer for the stack the spec names; install base dependencies (framework, core runtime, only what the first slice needs); lay out directories; confirm a dev server or build runs. **Keep the repo the initializer creates (never discard it when relocating the project); if it made none and git integration is on, `git init`.** Scaffold steps derive from the stack decision (a decision spec has no build plan). Install just in time: NOT every library the spec names (email, monitoring, and so on); each later feature installs its own when built; only cross cutting tooling (lint, format, type strictness) comes early, via `/audit` + the tooling task. Then proceed.

Otherwise `/develop` builds into an existing project. No skeleton (no `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`go.mod`/manifest, no source tree) and not the scaffold task → stop:

> No project found to build into. Run the scaffold step first (the Stack and architecture feature's scaffold sub task, per your architecture spec), then run `/develop` again.

A project exists (even a bare scaffold) → proceed.

### Before you build: freshness & collaboration (don't build on stale state or over a teammate)

Before mutating anything (skip silently if solo, offline, or not using git): `git fetch` quietly; base = `main`, else `master`; behind count (`git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/<base>`); uncommitted work (`git status --short`).

- Behind (count > 0) → stop and warn: "You're N commits behind `origin/$BASE`. A teammate may have already changed or shipped this. Pull first, then run again."
- Uncommitted work in the area you'll touch → warn: "You have uncommitted changes here. Commit or stash first so this build doesn't tangle with them." Let them proceed if they insist.
- Feature `in-progress` in the scope AND its code area (pointer line's path) has recent commits by another author (`git log --format='%an' -- <area>`) → warn: "_<feature>_ looks like it's partway through the build by someone else. Coordinate before continuing it." Confirm before proceeding.

Warnings, not hard blocks, but surface them.

**Git integration:** if the nearest `AGENTS.md` `## Git` says `integration: on`, read `flow/git.md` and follow it (branch before building, commit as milestones land); absent or `off` → do no active git.

### Step 0: The spec gate (always first)

Is a decision owed and unrecorded? Do NOT judge this by introspection ("do I feel like I'm inventing something?"), the build model rationalizes a real decision as "just wiring" and waves it through. Use a positive **input coverage** test, which is mechanical and harder to talk yourself out of:

> **Enumerate every value this build must produce, compute, or display (from the acceptance criteria and the spec's design). For each, does the spec name where it comes from (an input, a DB column, a derivation from a named value, a prior decision)? Any required value with no named source is an owed decision.**

If any source is unnamed, stop and route to the gate (`/architect`; record Blocked and the missing sources, never invent a decision). A decision is also owed when you'd have to invent:

- **A provider, library, integration, data model, or cross cutting pattern** (e.g. auth provider, DB/ORM, caching strategy).
- **A whole UI page or screen**: its design system (`design.md` there? if not, which direction?), sections/composition, component inventory, asset strategy (no screenshot, no repo images → e.g. an online source). Owed unless a `design.md` AND a page level spec pin these down.
- **A feature's behavior** (search, a wizard: "what exactly should it do?" is open; `/architect` asks those questions). Owed unless a spec defines it.

**What "local implementation detail" actually means (the narrow exception):** ONLY a choice among options the spec's named sources already permit, a loop style, a variable name, which helper to call. The moment a choice **determines a value's source, or a behavior an acceptance criterion constrains**, it is load bearing by definition, however small it looks. Deriving "the user's today from the timezone on their last read row" is not a local detail: it picks the source of a value an AC constrains, so it is owed. NOT owed for genuine pure implementation: a small bug fix, a component matching an existing `design.md`, wiring pieces whose sources the spec already names, a copy tweak, anything an existing spec/`design.md`/`AGENTS.md` fully governs.

Don't hardcode to page names or to any one example (timezone is an illustration of the pattern, not a rule); apply the input coverage test to whatever was asked. False negatives are the failure mode, building a real decision without noticing: when a required value's source is unnamed, or you are unsure, treat as owed and ask (panel below).

Read only what this feature needs, never the whole `docs/` tree: its one scope file and its one governing spec (single file, or umbrella `index.md` plus the one child speccing this sub task). No other features' rows, scope files, workspaces, or unrelated specs.

**Check, in order:**

1. **Locate this feature in `docs/scope/PLAN.md` (or workspace scope in a monorepo).** Check that the feature is planned or in progress and points to a governing spec in `docs/specs/`.
2. **Open the governing spec via the feature's `spec` pointer.** Verify that `Status: Accepted` is set and all decision sources are documented (data model, API contracts, calculations, rules, error handling).
3. The **nearest** `AGENTS.md` (workspace/area) may capture prior conventions. Check that conventions are respected.

**Mandatory Decision Check:**
A decision is owed whenever you would have to invent:

- A data model, entity schema, migration, or field types
- An API surface, method, route path, or status codes
- A security rule, authorization check, or permission model
- An external integration provider, secret name, or library choice
- A calculation formula or business rule with no explicit source
- A feature's behavior or workflow state transitions

If any decision is unrecorded or if the governing spec is not in `Status: Accepted`:

- Do not build.
- Do not assume decisions or create Assumed specs (strictly prohibited by `AGENTS.md`).
- Mark status `Blocked` in `workflow/STATE.md` with the specific missing decisions noted.
- Route to `/architect <feature>` to settle the decision in a spec first:

> Run this next, then come back to `/develop`:
>
> ```
> /architect <feature>: <the specific decision to settle>
> ```
>
> Once the spec is Accepted, run `/develop <task>` again and I will build to it.

### Build flow (Steps 1-4)

Once the gate clears (the governing spec is Accepted and the Decision Check passes with zero missing decisions), read `flow/build.md` and follow its Steps 1-4: classify the track, load the decision and conventions, explore, optional doc check, build, then update the scope and report.
