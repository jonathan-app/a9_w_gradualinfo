# Develop: build flow (Steps 1-4, after the Step 0 spec gate passes)

Read this only after the governing spec is Accepted and the Decision Check has zero gaps. Tracks are additive: UI, Logical, or both.

Guide paths below (`ui-guide.md`, `logical-guide.md`, `checklist.md`) are relative to the develop skill folder (the parent of this `flow/` directory).

### Step 1: Classify the track

| Signals                                                                                                  | Track                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "page", "component", "screen", "layout", "ui"; a screenshot is attached; visual work against `design.md` | **UI** → `ui-guide.md`                |
| "api", "endpoint", "service", "functionality", "logic", "data", "job", "webhook", "integration"          | **Logical** → `logical-guide.md`      |
| Both present (e.g. "auth": pages + session logic)                                                        | **Both**: run each track for its part |

If genuinely ambiguous, ask once: "Is this the UI, the logic behind it, or both?"

### Step 2: Load the decision and conventions (both tracks)

Read:

1. **The governing spec** (feature's `spec` pointer, or Step 0), build spec sections only: `## Requirements` (user stories + IDed acceptance criteria `<feature>/AC-01…`; the contract, and the source of the Step 4 verify steps), `## Decision`, the design/spec section (`## Feature design` / `## Proposed stack` / spec table), `## Build plan` (ordered tasks tagged "satisfies AC-N"; the data model migration sized to the feature), `## Consequences` (constraints). Skip `## Context`, `## Options considered`, `## Rationale` (decision history, not build input) unless a constraint needs the reasoning. Umbrella `index.md` → read the index (decision + child list; `## Structure` maps every child; the index holds any cross child contract), then only the child spec(s) this sub task touches (usually one; a second only if it truly spans two, never all), build spec sections only. Never read the spec's `rationale.md` for a build. **Check the `Status`**: `Accepted` → required before building. A spec with explicit decision sources and status `Accepted` is the mandatory entry gate for develop. `Proposed` → do not build; route to `/architect` to deliberate and ratify the spec first. `Assumed` → strictly prohibited per `AGENTS.md`. `Superseded` → use the superseding spec.
2. **The nearest `AGENTS.md`** to the target code area (Claude Code loads it automatically; read explicitly to be sure). It carries decisions synced from earlier features: don't ask again what's settled.
3. **`design.md`** (UI track only): the visual source of truth.
4. **The build approach**, precedence: the feature's scope row `Approach` override if declared, else the project default in root `AGENTS.md`, else the scope file's header. Strategies: vertical end to end slice, thinnest usable whole, UI shell first prototype wired later, full user journey per phase. Governs _how you assemble_ the slice in Step 3, not _what_ it contains (the spec fixes that). None recorded → default to a coherent end to end slice, every layer the feature spans (data → logic → interface → UI). Reason from the strategy's principle, not a fixed per approach recipe.
5. **Tool skills**: the spec's `## Decision` **Implementation skills** field names them (e.g. an ORM, an auth library); `AGENTS.md`'s `## Agent skills` section lists what's installed, one bullet per skill with its location. Open the `SKILL.md` (the path from that bullet or the spec field is real and readable) of each one materially governing the code you're about to write and follow its conventions. On demand only: just the skills this sub task touches, not all. On Claude Code a skill may activate on its own; read it explicitly anyway. Unreadable → build from the spec plus knowledge, note it.

**Monorepo: work inside the target workspace.** Workspaces config or `apps/*`/`packages/*` manifests → identify the feature's workspace (code pointer, or task path) and operate there: its nested `AGENTS.md` and `design.md`, its `package.json`/stack, write into its tree, run its commands (`dev`/`build`/`test`, scoped to that workspace, e.g. `<pkgmgr> --filter <workspace> …` or the monorepo task runner's filtered command). The checks before you start apply to that workspace; its scope is `docs/scope/<workspace>/`.

**Precedence on conflict:** follow `AGENTS.md` and the local workflow contract. A feature spec may specialize behavior within that contract, not waive its gates. Flag contradictions and route to architect before dependent implementation.

**Spec completeness check (before any code, not partway).** Two passes:

1. **Sections present:** logical → data model, API surface, security model, key invariants; UI → screens and their states. Missing or placeholder → ask (panel below).
2. **Input coverage (catches the silent decision):** enumerate every value each code path must produce or display for the ACs; for each, confirm the spec names its source (input, DB column, derivation, prior decision, the spec's **Value sourcing** table). A required value with **no named source** is a load bearing gap, the case the builder is tempted to fill as "local wiring": it decides the source of an AC constrained value, so treat it as a missing load bearing section and ask; never invent the source.

**A missing source or behavior is a decision gap.** Record `Blocked` with the missing field in STATE and route to architect. An answer supplied in chat must be recorded and approved in the spec by architect before the dependent build resumes. Pagination size, sort order, and user facing behavior are not local details when the spec leaves them undecided. Variable names and equivalent implementations within an already named source remain develop's choice.

### Step 2.5: Explore before building (isolate the reading)

Locating files to touch and patterns/interfaces to match and reuse means reading code (every opened file stays in the main context all session). Isolate it in a read only subagent that returns a compact map (~1 to 2k tokens).

- **Skip it** when the change is tiny and you know the file, or on a fresh session where context is light.
- **Run it** when the reading would bloat the main context: a large or monorepo repo, many files, an unfamiliar area.

Spawn a read only exploration subagent (Claude Code: the `scout` subagent type, which pins a fast, low cost model; else Cursor `Explore`, Antigravity `research`, Codex `spawn_agent`; else a plain subagent, or inline if your agent has none). Where the type does not pin it, set a fast, low cost model explicitly, never the session model. Tools `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` only, no `Edit`/`Write`. Brief: target workspace, exact sub task, the spec's key interfaces; return only a compact map, files to create/edit (paths), patterns/conventions to match (`file:line`), symbols/types/helpers to reuse, and gotchas, no file contents or dumps.

Build from the map (Step 3): the reading is offloaded, the deciding and writing stay on the main thread.

**Large repos & monorepos:** hold the Step 0 read scope, one sub task per run, build inline.

### Step 2.6: Doc check (only when needed): offload current usage lookups to a web subagent

Only when you genuinely need the current usage/API of a tool the spec already decided (fast moving or newly released) and you're unsure your knowledge is current. Most builds don't need it: on a stable stack, build from knowledge and let the typecheck/build/lint loop catch a stale API. Never to choose or reconsider a tool (`/architect`'s job): look up _how to use_ the decided tool, not _whether_; if docs reveal it can't work, that's the "spec is wrong" path (Step 3), not a silent swap. Not a second fetch of the spec's reference links (human facing, verified at design time).

**How (capability first):** spawn a read only web subagent (on Claude Code the `researcher` type, which pins a fast, low cost model and carries the web tools; else your agent's web/browse tool), its model set explicitly to a fast, low cost tier (not the session model), briefed with the exact tools/versions from the spec and the one thing you need. Return only a compact usage summary (current call/config/setup, version notes, gotchas), never raw pages. No web capability → skip: build from knowledge, lean on the build/typecheck loop, note the assumption.

### Step 3: Resume check, then build

**Task source.** Read atomic tasks from the Accepted spec. Record completion by task ID in STATE and milestone boxes in PLAN; never tick or rewrite spec content. Missing spec or missing task coverage returns to architect.

**Build the coherent slice the approach defines.** Cross check the tasks against requirements and API/UI surfaces. Required but uncovered work returns to architect to update the build plan before implementation; do not silently add or defer spec tasks.

**Resume first; never rebuild completed work.** Use the feature's PLAN and STATE evidence to find the first incomplete task from the Accepted spec. Keep `existing` and `dropped` entries unchanged unless the requested work explicitly reopens them. Set delivery to `Developing` in STATE and `in-progress` in PLAN. Never change spec status or accept an old Assumed spec.

**Gather remaining inline answers** (the Step 2 spec gap answer, UI asset and design direction questions, an ambiguous business rule) before any build handoff; they need the engineer.

**With the Step 2.5 map in hand, the build is a write step done inline on the main thread.** Do not spawn a subagent to write code, even for a very large or multi file build; sequence it sensibly.

Tracks:

- **UI** → follow `ui-guide.md` inline (component or screen → stack/styling/dark mode detection → asset resolution → tokens → font → the five phases → accessibility); the main thread keeps design/asset questions responsive.
- **Logical: normal build** → inline per `logical-guide.md` (ground in the spec → data layer → core logic → interface → integration → correctness pass).
- **Logical: very large single build** → still inline. Work through it in ordered chunks per `logical-guide.md`, recording completed build task IDs in STATE as each lands and its typecheck passes; use `/compact` partway through the build if the single feature runs long (the scope and spec hold the state, so nothing is lost).
- **Logical: big rollout of an already decided pattern** (e.g. "swap inline inputs across 17 files") → still inline, sequenced to stay safe:
  1. **Primitive first**: build the shared thing (helper/module/schema) and confirm it typechecks before touching call sites.
  2. **Apply site by site**: work through the files in turn, applying `<primitive>` per the pattern the spec fixes, preserving exact behavior; tick each as it lands.
  3. **Gate once at the end**: package wide typecheck/lint and `/check verify` after all sites are migrated, not after each. Remove the superseded code only on this green sweep (ALL sites migrated AND typecheck/lint passing): sites not migrated still reference it, deleting early breaks the build.
  4. **Partial progress; don't migrate only halfway**: if you stop before every site is done, keep the old code, leave the feature `in-progress`, report migrated versus pending sites explicitly (which files landed, which remain), and say running `/develop` again resumes the pending sites (it detects and skips migrated ones; idempotent and resumable). The old code comes out on the run where the last site lands green.
- **Both** → track order follows the build approach, not a fixed rule. Default (and for an end to end / tracer bullet slice): logical interface first so the UI binds to something real, then UI. Facade (UI shell first): UI on placeholder data first, wire the logical layer after.

**Spec wrong partway through the build → update the spec before patching; never silently diverge.** The spec proves wrong or incomplete partway through the build (e.g. the decided data model can't hold, or an acceptance criterion contradicts the API surface): if building correctly means deviating from the spec, STOP before coding the deviation, route to `/architect` to update or supersede the spec (paste ready `/architect <feature>: <what the spec got wrong>`), resume once the spec reflects reality.

**A data layer build isn't done until its migration is applied and verified**: generate the migration, run it against the target DB, confirm the schema is live (tables/columns/relationships exist; query the DB or its introspection, not just the migration file) before ticking. Generated but unapplied = not done. (`logical-guide.md`, Phase 2.)

**Remove superseded code; old and new must not coexist.** A build that replaces an existing pattern or implementation (a refactor, or an approach swapping rollout) includes the deletion: remove dead functions, unreachable branches, orphaned files, unused imports; verify nothing still references them (search for callers/imports; typecheck/build/lint clean with the old code gone). Old and new side by side = not done. Timing: single site → delete the moment the new code is in and typecheck is green; multi site rollout → per rollout points 3 and 4 above.

**Follow the spec's verify protocol.** If the spec specifies how to verify (common with no test runner, e.g. "`<pkgmgr> -F <pkg> typecheck` must pass after every sub task", or "diff API responses before/after"), run exactly that after each sub task/batch; a sub task isn't done until it passes. Don't assume a test suite exists.

### Step 4: Update the scope and report

- **Only mark what actually landed.** Confirm first: files written, code present and typechecking; data layer task → migration applied and schema confirmed live, not merely generated. Interrupted or half done sub task → leave the task unchecked, keep the feature `in-progress`, report exactly what's incomplete and why. Never mark a task `done` on an unverified or incomplete build.
- **Record task evidence in STATE and milestones in PLAN.** Tick only built and verified milestones, reference the spec task IDs, and fill the code pointer. Never edit spec tasks or content. Report the changed progress lines.
- **Build completion is not delivery completion.** Keep the feature in progress and route to verify, review, security, tests, documentation, and sync. Tiers do not waive local gates. Missing evidence is Not run or Blocked, never done.

- **Preserve spec status.** The governing spec was already `Accepted` before the build started. Do not edit the spec's decision status line. Record delivery progress in `workflow/STATE.md` and `docs/scope/PLAN.md`.
- **Write a verification plan:** derive observable steps from the ACs and the value sourcing table, including the edge inputs that distinguish correct sources. Save them in `check/<feature>/<run-id>/VERIFY-PLAN.md`, marked `Not run`. Preserve existing plans and cite the Accepted spec. A plan is not execution evidence. Never write VERIFY.md from a build or restructure specs. Each planned step names its `<feature>/AC-01` style criterion and expected result; `/check verify` records actual observations separately.

- Relay the track's report (the `## /develop complete` block from `ui-guide.md` and/or `logical-guide.md`).
- **Route to the next incomplete required gate** using PLAN and STATE. If a required box is missing, flag the scope gap and still name the gate. After a build the next stage is `/check verify`, then `/check review`, `/security`, `/test`, `/document`, and `/sync`. A one off feature follows the same local requirements. Suggest a fresh session only after durable progress is saved.

`/develop` builds; it does not run `/check verify`, `/test`, `/sync`, or `/architect` for you, it points; you decide.
