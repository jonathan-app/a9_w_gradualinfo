# Sync Maintenance Guide (main thread)

You, the main thread, read and follow this at write time (Step 3). Read each ALL_CAPS placeholder as the matching input you gathered in the earlier steps.

You maintain a project's durable knowledge after a code change. Your job is narrow: the steps below define all of it. Be conservative: when in doubt, flag rather than write.

**Canonical file:** durable context lives in the tool agnostic **`AGENTS.md`**; **`CLAUDE.md` is only a pointer** importing its sibling AGENTS.md via Claude Code's `@` directive. Never write content into a CLAUDE.md, never overwrite an existing AGENTS.md. When you create a new nested `AGENTS.md`, also create its sibling `CLAUDE.md` containing only:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This project's context for all AI tools lives in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).
Claude Code loads it via the import below:

@AGENTS.md
```

## The change

- **Scope mode**: MODE
- **Base / merge base**: BASE / MERGE_BASE
- **Changed source files (with status A/M/R)**: CHANGED_FILES
- **Deleted paths (status D, for orphan cleanup only)**: DELETED_PATHS
- **All changed paths for delivery reconciliation**: RECONCILIATION_PATHS
- **Persistent delivery state to reconcile**: STATE_PATH

See exactly what changed with:

```
DIFF_COMMAND
```

**Default to doing nothing.** Code that doesn't alter a command, convention, constraint, dependency, or structural layout does not belong in durable knowledge; a line that just narrates what this change did is churn, not maintenance. No context change is a normal outcome, but still reconcile delivery from changed tests, docs, and reports before returning NOTHING_TO_SYNC.

## Existing context files (you may EDIT these; you may CREATE a nested AGENTS.md + its CLAUDE.md pointer for a net new area only)

- **Root AGENTS.md (inlined)**:

ROOT_AGENTS_MD

- **Nested AGENTS.md paths**: NESTED_PATHS
- **Changed file → nearest context file**: FILE_TO_CONTEXT_MAP

## Specs (read only; you may FLAG staleness, you must NOT edit spec content or status)

SPEC_PATHS

## Feature scope for the relevant workspace(s) the diff touches (canonical docs/scope/PLAN.md or workspace scope; you may RECONCILE status only, never add/remove/reorder features)

SCOPE_PATH_OR_NONE

## Tool discovery result from the main model

- **Installed Agent Skills**: INSTALLED_SKILLS_OR_NONE
- **MCP servers selected or recommended**: MCP_SERVERS_OR_NONE
- **Declined or skipped tools**: DECLINED_TOOLS_OR_NONE

---

## What to do

### 1. Update existing AGENTS.md files (only where the change made them inaccurate)

Read the diff. For each existing root/nested AGENTS.md whose area was touched, check whether the change altered a command (build/test/run/scripts), a convention, constraint, or dependency, broke a file pointer (target moved or removed), or added a new durable rule that belongs in that existing doc.

Make the edit only if it is:

- **Surgical**: change or add specific lines, never rewrite sections.
- **Additive or corrective**: add a missing fact or fix a wrong one. Never delete curated guidance you don't fully understand.
- **Durable**: true beyond this one change. Skip one off notes, history, and feature summaries.

### The mirrored root fields

<!-- ROOT-FIELD-CONTRACT:START (identical in /audit and /sync; edit both or neither) -->

Root `AGENTS.md` carries two mirrored fields. Each has exactly one source of truth outside the file, and no skill may invent a value for either:

- `## Stack` mirrors the architecture spec, the one under `docs/specs/` with a `## Proposed stack` section.
- `## Build approach` mirrors the scope header's build approach line, the one `/scope` records.

Three rules bind every skill that touches them. Never overwrite curated prose in either field. Fill a field only when it is missing or still a placeholder. When a field and its source disagree, flag the divergence and name the file you read the source from, rather than picking a winner.
<!-- ROOT-FIELD-CONTRACT:END -->

What `/sync` does with them: reconcile, one line at a time.

- **Missing the value its source sets** (e.g. a greenfield root seeded before the architecture spec landed, or a root with no build approach line while the scope header names one): add that one line surgically, and record it under `AGENTS_UPDATED`.
- **Field and source disagree**, or root's version is elaborated curated prose, or you cannot tell which side is authoritative: do not overwrite. Flag it under `CONFLICTS`, naming the spec or scope file you compared against.

`/sync` never restructures root or creates it; that is `/audit`'s job (see the Boundaries table in `SKILL.md`).

**Agent Skill and MCP records:** if `INSTALLED_SKILLS_OR_NONE`, `MCP_SERVERS_OR_NONE`, or `DECLINED_TOOLS_OR_NONE` is not `none`, record it surgically in the most specific relevant AGENTS.md:

- Project wide tools (framework, ORM, styling, core DB, hosting, test runner) belong in root AGENTS.md.
- Area specific tools (payments, auth, email, uploads, search, queues) belong in that area's nested AGENTS.md when one exists; otherwise add a short root note and flag the area under `CONTEXT_GAPS`.
- An installed skill goes in the `## Agent skills` section as its own bullet so only needed skills load: `- [<skill>](<skills-dir>/<skill>/): `<owner>/<repo>`, <what it covers>`, using the project's real skills dir (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or `skills/`, never a hardcoded Claude only path, since every tool reads this file) and keeping the registry source `<owner>/<repo>` as the tool agnostic identity. Create the `## Agent skills` section if the doc lacks one (append near the end, before `## Context files` in root); never fold skills back into a single dense line of names.
- A declined tool and a connected/recommended MCP server stay compact lines in that section (they have nothing to load): `Declined: <tool>` · `MCP servers: <server> (connected|recommended)`.
- Idempotent: if the same installed, recommended, connected, or declined item is already recorded (even worded differently), do not add it again.
- Record selected MCPs as recommended unless the main thread explicitly says connected.

**Design system pointer:** if this change added or established a `design.md` (the UI design system, art direction plus the build mandate) and the nearest AGENTS.md has no pointer to it, add one surgical line: ``- Design system: build all UI to `design.md` (art direction and the maximalist product bar); token values live in CSS.`` Put it in root AGENTS.md for a project-wide `design.md`, or the UI area's nested AGENTS.md if the system is area-scoped. Idempotent: skip if a `design.md` pointer already exists. Never paste design.md content into AGENTS.md; it is a pointer, not a copy.

Rules you must not break:

- **Idempotent, check before you add.** Read the target doc again now. If the fact, command, or pointer is already present, even worded differently, do not add it again: /sync run twice on the same change must make zero new edits the second time.
- **Never overwrite or rewrite curated prose.** If accuracy would require rewriting an author's curated paragraph, record it under `CONFLICTS` for a human instead.
- Keep root AGENTS.md short and globally relevant; area specific detail belongs in a nested doc.

### 2. Create a nested AGENTS.md: only for an area NET-NEW in this change

You may create **one** nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` for an area the change introduced wholesale. The test is **context, not policy**:

- **Create it** when every source file in that area carries status `A` (added) in CHANGED_FILES: the diff shows you the entire area. If any file in the area is `M` (modified), the area already existed: do NOT create. Write a focused doc: local file pointers, local commands, conventions/constraints visible in the new code, links to any governing spec. End it with the one line note: `_Drafted by /sync from the introducing change, worth a quick human pass._` Then add exactly one pointer line to root AGENTS.md under `## Context files`:

  ```
  - [<area>/AGENTS.md](<area>/AGENTS.md): <one-line description>
  ```

  **Idempotency + missing section**: skip the pointer if already present; if root has no `## Context files` heading, create it (append near the end of root) and add the pointer under it.

  Also create the sibling **`<area>/CLAUDE.md` pointer** (per the Canonical file block above) so Claude Code picks up the new area too.

- **Area that already exists, defer to /audit**: the diff shows only a slice of an area that predates this change, so you lack the whole area context to write a good doc. Record it under `CONTEXT_GAPS`.
- **Never create or restructure the root AGENTS.md.** If the repo has no root AGENTS.md at all, that's /audit's job; record under `CONTEXT_GAPS`.
- One nested doc per genuinely distinct new area, never one per folder.

### 3. Clean up orphans from deletions

For each path in DELETED_PATHS:

- A nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` describing code that no longer exists is orphaned. Remove it only if the whole area was deleted (the directory is gone); if only some files went, correct the now broken file pointers inside the doc instead.
- When you remove a nested doc, also remove its pointer line from root's `## Context files`.
- Fix any file pointer in any AGENTS.md that targets a deleted/moved path.
- Record removals under `ORPHANS_CLEANED`. If unsure a deletion is permanent, flag under `CONFLICTS` instead of deleting.

### 4. Decision specs are read only (do NOT edit Status line or spec content)

Spec decision status reflects architectural ratification (`Proposed` → `Accepted` → `Superseded`), owned exclusively by `/architect`. Feature build and delivery lifecycle is tracked in the scope (`docs/scope/PLAN.md`) and `workflow/STATE.md` (`planned` → `in-progress` → `done`).

`/sync` never alters or downgrades a spec's `**Status**:` line based on implementation progress. A spec remains `Accepted` once ratified by architect so that `/develop` can build against it. If the implementation contradicts an accepted spec, flag it under `STALE_SPECS` (Step 5).

### 5. Flag stale specs (do not edit their content)

Be **strict**, noise erodes trust. Read a spec only if the changed paths plausibly touch its subject (judge from its title/first lines; don't read all blindly). Flag it **only when you can name the specific decision the change contradicts**, e.g. the spec mandates one datastore and this change adds an adapter for a different one, or the spec fixes an interface/boundary the change breaks. Also flag a spec a **later spec supersedes** (its status should become `Superseded`, /architect's job, not a Status line reconciliation). Never flag vague "might be affected" cases; when in doubt, do not flag. Record genuine hits under `STALE_SPECS` with the contradicted point and recommend /architect to update or supersede; never edit spec content yourself.

### 6. Reconcile the feature scope (only if SCOPE_PATH_OR_NONE is a path)

**Scope:** only the scope file(s) you were handed. Never hunt for or reconcile other files under `docs/scope/`; one workspace's change does not license editing another's.

You are the **universal sub task reconciler**: `/develop` ticks its own sub tasks; `/test`, `/audit`, and `/sync` sub tasks have no one else. For **every feature the diff touched**, evaluate each of its sub tasks again against repo evidence (not just what this diff added) and tick the genuinely complete ones: the diff picks _which features_ to check again, the repo state decides _which sub tasks are done_. Look directly with Read/Bash/Grep/Glob.

**Malformed scope** (no `At-a-glance` table or feature sections, a status that is not standard, broken headings, a bad hand edit): do not edit it; note `scope malformed: <file>, needs a human or /scope re-run` under `SCOPE_RECONCILED` and skip it. Never act on a misread.

> Step 1's source file filtering (dropping `*.test.*`, `docs/**`) governs what you sync AGENTS.md from; it does not limit reconciliation. Here you may and should inspect test files, AGENTS.md, and config to judge completion.

Evidence per sub task type (tick `[ ]` → `[x]` when the evidence is clearly present):

- **UI / data model / backend / integration / data integration** → task evidence and applicable passing runtime checks for the implemented surface, not file existence alone.
- **Build it (+ milestones)** → task execution evidence in STATE, including actual build/typecheck results and live migration verification where applicable; presence of code alone does not prove completion.
- **Verify it** → current `VERIFY.md` with PASS, observed execution, and complete required criteria/surfaces. A plan or checklist never qualifies.
- **Security audit** → applicable `SECURITY.md` with completed scan, Passed or acknowledged Warning, no active Critical/High, and matching feature, version, and target. Validate identity and conflicts per the local contract.
- **Test it** → current `TEST.md` with Passed, executed command, exit code zero, supporting output, and complete required coverage. Test files alone never qualify.
- **Review it (fresh model)** → current `REVIEW.md` with Approve or Approve with nits and no open blockers. Changes requested or Blocked never qualifies; disclose reviewer model and actual independence.
- **Document it** → a PR body, a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, or a release note covering this feature (`/document`'s output).
- **SEO & metadata** → metadata/structured data present on the feature's pages.
- **Sync (record conventions)** → the area's `AGENTS.md` exists and reflects the feature.
- **Coding standards / tooling** → linter/formatter/`pre-commit` config present in the repo.

Then reconcile PLAN and STATE. Read each report, its result, coverage, and version identity under the local contract. Required gates missing from PLAN remain required: flag scope to add them and leave delivery incomplete. Record the most recent applicable result, evidence link, next step, and any blocking reason. Keep `in-progress` until all applicable gates pass; set `done` in PLAN and `Done` in STATE only after evidence supports the full chain. Preserve publication/merge as unperformed unless its actual operation is recorded. A failed or invalidated gate reopens the affected task and delivery with a reason; preserve prior execution history. Do not change unrelated existing deliveries.

- **Strictly status only.** Never add, remove, rename, or reorder features or checkboxes (that's /scope's). Skip `existing` and `dropped` features entirely. Never invent a feature for code that has no section; if shipped code clearly matches no feature, note "unmapped: <area>, run /scope to enroll this off plan work" under `SCOPE_RECONCILED`.
- **Attribution across features and workspaces.** Only tick a sub task when the file→feature mapping is **unambiguous** (the file lives in that feature's code area and matches that sub task). In a monorepo, a changed file's **workspace** (`apps/<x>/…`) selects the scope to update, `docs/scope/<x>/`; never tick a feature in the wrong workspace's scope. If an area maps to more than one feature, do not guess; note `ambiguous: <area> → <featureA> / <featureB>` under `SCOPE_RECONCILED`.
- **Idempotent**: the same evidence yields the same state. Reopen a checked box only when new failures or version changes invalidate its evidence; record why.
- **Conservative**: tick only on clearly present evidence; when unsure, leave it.
- **Git**: if root `AGENTS.md` `## Git` says `integration: on` and `commit` is not `manual`, offer to commit the reconciliation with a one line subject (`chore(sync): reconcile docs`) plus the `Co-Authored-By` trailer; never push.

### 7. Report

Include STATE transitions and evidence paths. With only docs/tests changes, report the reconciliation result even if no AGENTS facts changed.

Output exactly this block, verbatim, no extra prose. Omit any section that's empty.

```
SCOPE: <N> changed files

AGENTS_UPDATED:
- <path>, <what you added or corrected, one line>

AGENTS_CREATED:
- <area>/AGENTS.md, <conventions captured; root pointer added>

ORPHANS_CLEANED:
- <path>, <removed orphaned doc / fixed broken pointer after deletion>

SCOPE_RECONCILED:
- <feature>, <sub-tasks ticked / status advanced to match the diff; or "unmapped: <area>">

STALE_SPECS:
- <docs/specs/file>, <why the change makes it stale, or a status mismatch you couldn't safely reconcile>

CONTEXT_GAPS:
- <area>, <pre-existing undocumented area only sliced by this change; suggest /audit>

CONFLICTS:
- <path>, <curated content that would need rewriting; left for a human>
```

If you made no edits and found nothing stale, output `SCOPE: <N> changed files` followed by `NOTHING_TO_SYNC: everything is already current`.
